                - If no invoice is mentioned in the query and it is referring to all invoices, search across all {context_text}.
                - If the query is related to the last query, use the last referenced invoice {st.session_state.last_invoice}.
                - If the query involves numerical comparisons (e.g., total due amounts greater than $10,000),
                  take key-value pairs in total context and then compare based on key given in query.
                - Always check and verify extracted numerical values before answering any question.
                - If the question is unrelated, respond: "I don't know, but I can help with invoice-related questions."
